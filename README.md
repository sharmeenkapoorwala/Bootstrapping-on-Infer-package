# Effects of MDL Treatment on Rabbit Blood Pressure Using Bootstrap Analysis

Research Question & Objectives
In comparison to a saline (placebo) control, the purpose of this study is to determine if the
administration of the 5 − 𝐻𝑇3 antagonist modifies the dose–response relationship of mean arterial
blood pressure variations generated by increasing doses of phenylbiguanide in rabbits. In particular,
we want to estimate confidence intervals for the variations in blood-pressure response between
treatment and control groups over dosages using a resampling (bootstrapping) technique.
Motivation
The initial experiment aimed to determine if phenylbiguanide-induced cardiogenic chemoreflex is
dependent on 5−𝐻𝑇3 receptor activation. Given the very small sample (5 rabbits, repeated measures),
using contemporary resampling (bootstrap) techniques enables a non-parametric evaluation of
variability and more reliable inference. Classical parametric tests can be supplemented (or replaced)
by bootstrap confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, which account for repeated-measures structure
and make less assumptions on distributional shape.
Data Description
The Rabbit dataset is from the MASS package in R which includes 60 observations of variations in
rabbit blood pressure under various experimental settings. BPchange (change in blood pressure
relative to the start of the experiment), Dose (dose of Phenylbiguanide in micrograms), Run (label of
run (“C1” to “C5”, then “M1” to “M5”)), Treatment (placebo or the 5-HT_3 antagonist MDL 72222)
and Animal (label of animal used (“R1” to “R5”)).Each rabbit in the experiment (from Ludbrook,
1994) was given both treatment conditions and escalating intravenous doses of PBG, a 5-HT� agonist
that causes a cardiogenic chemoreflex, every 10 minutes. The purpose was to determine whether
5-HT� receptor activation is necessary for PBG-induced blood pressure changes.
Methods
In this work, we used regression, mixed-effects modeling, and hypothesis testing to look at how
therapy affected blood pressure changes. We also used bootstrap techniques to deal with the
repeated-measures design. We conducted a one-sample, two-sided bootstrap hypothesis test (using
infer) based on the average within-rabbit differences across doses to determine whether the mean
difference in BPchange between treatment and control differs from zero. Despite the enormous sample
size, bootstrap resampling was chosen since repeated measurements contradict independence.
Next, we expanded the results to a regression model with dose, 𝑑𝑜𝑠𝑒2 and treatment as predictors
and the natural log of BPchange as the response. Since the normality and equal-variance requirements
were satisfied but the independence assumption was not, we used a cluster bootstrap to estimate the
regression coefficients by treating each rabbit as a cluster and resampling entire clusters. Bootstrap
estimates of the model coefficients were obtained using the ClusterBootstrap package.

Concluding with a mixed-effects model, we introduce a model that accounts for within-subject
correlation by incorporating random effects for each animal alongside Treatment and Dose as
fixed effects, as well as their interactions. Dose is treated as a factor with six levels (6.25, 12.5,
25, 50, 100, 200 𝜇𝑔) to evaluate the effects of dose level on blood pressure change. Examining
model assumptions, we find that normality is satisfied, while equal variance displayed slight
heteroscedasticity.Independence continues to be violated due to the repeated measurements of
rabbits. Bootstrapping using the bootMer() function from the lme4 package was implemented to
generate confidence intervals by applying parametric resampling to the model to extract fixed effect
estimates. This final procedure allowed us to examine the effects of treatment at each dose level
while accounting for subject variability.
